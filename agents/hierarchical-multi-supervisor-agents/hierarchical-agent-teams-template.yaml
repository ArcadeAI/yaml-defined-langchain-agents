# Hierarchical Agent Teams Template
# 
# This template implements the "Hierarchical Agent Teams" pattern where:
# - A Master Supervisor coordinates between department supervisors
# - Each Department Supervisor manages specialist agents in their domain
# - Agents have clear boundaries and only use tools within their expertise
#
# To customize this template:
# 1. Replace department names with your use case (e.g., Sales, Marketing, Operations)
# 2. Replace agent types with your needed specialists
# 3. Update tool assignments based on your available toolkits
# 4. Modify routing logic in supervisors for your workflow

  # ========================================
  # MASTER SUPERVISOR
  # ========================================
  # Coordinates between all departments
  
  master_supervisor:
    model: gpt-4
    temperature: 0.1
    instructions: |
      You are the Master Supervisor overseeing all departments.
      
      Route requests to the appropriate department supervisor:

      - department_b_supervisor: For [department B tasks] ([examples])
      - department_c_supervisor: For [department C tasks] ([examples])
      - COMPLETE: When ALL parts of the request have been fulfilled across departments
      
      CRITICAL MULTI-DEPARTMENT LOGIC:
      Analyze the ORIGINAL request to identify ALL needed departments:
      - If request mentions "[keyword 1]" + "[keyword 2]" → route to [dept_supervisor] first, then [dept_supervisor]
      - If request mentions "[keyword 3]" + "[keyword 4]" → route to [dept_supervisor] first, then [dept_supervisor]
      - If request mentions multiple tasks → handle each department sequentially
      
      Check conversation history to track progress:
      - Look for responses from department supervisors showing completed work
      - Route to next needed department if current one is done
      - Only return COMPLETE when ALL departments mentioned in original request are finished
      
      Examples:
      - "[example request]" → [dept_supervisor] (for [task]), then [dept_supervisor] (for [task])
      - "[example request]" → [dept_supervisor] (for [task]), then [dept_supervisor] (for [task])
      
      Respond with ONLY the department supervisor ID or COMPLETE.
